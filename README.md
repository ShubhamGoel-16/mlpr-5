Q1) Common distance metrics used in distance-based classification algorithms include Euclidean distance, which measures the straight-line distance 
between two points; Manhattan distance, which sums the absolute differences along each dimension; and Minkowski distance, a generalized form that 
includes both Euclidean and Manhattan distances as special cases. Other important metrics include Cosine similarity, which measures the angle between 
vectors to capture orientation rather than magnitude, and Mahalanobis distance, which accounts for correlations between variables and scales data accordingly.

Q2)Distance-based classification algorithms have numerous real-world applications across various domains. In biometrics, they are used for facial
recognition and fingerprint matching by comparing feature distances. In medical diagnosis, they help classify diseases based on patient symptoms and
historical data. In recommender systems, these algorithms suggest products or content by measuring similarity between user preferences. They are also 
widely used in anomaly detection, such as fraud detection in banking and network intrusion detection in cybersecurity. 

Q3) Various distance metrics are used to measure similarity or dissimilarity between data points in classification and clustering algorithms. 
Euclidean distance is the most common metric, calculating the straight-line distance between two points in a multidimensional space. Manhattan
distance measures distance by summing the absolute differences along each dimension, making it suitable for grid-based movements. Minkowski distance
generalizes both Euclidean and Manhattan distances, with an adjustable parameter. Cosine similarity measures the angle between vectors, focusing on 
direction rather than magnitude, which is useful for text and high-dimensional data. Mahalanobis distance considers correlations between variables 
and normalizes distances based on variance, making it effective for identifying outliers and handling correlated features. The choice of metric 
depends on the data characteristics and the problem domain.

Q4) Cross-validation plays a crucial role in assessing and improving model performance by ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. 
It involves partitioning the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on some subsets while testing on others, and repeating this process
to obtain an average performance measure. K-fold cross-validation is widely used, where the data is split into k folds, and the model is trained 
and tested k times, each time using a different fold for validation. This reduces the risk of overfitting and provides a more reliable estimate of 
model accuracy. Cross-validation helps in hyperparameter tuning, model selection, and detecting biases in the dataset, ultimately leading to better
and more robust predictions.

Q5) n K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), bias and variance are influenced by the choice of K (the number of neighbors). A low K value (e.g., K = 1)
results in a highly flexible model that closely follows the training data, leading to low bias but high variance, making the model sensitive 
to noise and prone to overfitting. Conversely, a high K value results in a smoother decision boundary with high bias but low variance, making 
the model more generalized but potentially underfitting the data. The optimal choice of K balances bias and variance, ensuring the model captures 
patterns without excessive sensitivity to noise. Cross-validation is often used to determine the best K for minimizing both errors.
